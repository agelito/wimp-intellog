## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This console application is part of a tool called WIMP (WOMP Intel Management Program). The purpose of this application is to watch and read the in-game intel channel chat logs. Once any message was added the application will send the message data to [WIMP-Server](https://github.com/agelito/wimp-server) for processing.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). A distributed version control system.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Open source code editor.
* [NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). The SDK also includes the Runtime.
* The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.

After installing the prerequisites you can verify the installed dotnet version by typing this command in the terminal:
```
dotnet --version
